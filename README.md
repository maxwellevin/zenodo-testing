Learning how Zenodo DOI integration and badges work.

## Steps

1. Go to https://zenodo.org and create an account using your GitHub. You can also do it with your OrcID, but you will need to then also link your GitHub account.
2. Go to `Account Settings > GitHub` to see a list of your *public* repositories. Find the one you want to track.
3. Turn on tracking by clicking the toggle button next to the repository name. 
4. Create a tagged release on GitHub.
5. In the Zenodo portal refresh the page to see the DOI badge. Click on it and copy the Markdown/rst/etc text.
6. Insert it wherever you like. Most people do it in the README or documentation underneath the repository title.
